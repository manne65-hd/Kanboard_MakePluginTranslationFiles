Make (Kanboard)Plugin-Translation-Files
=======================================
A _(self-contained)_ CLI-tool to find all calls to Kanboard's translate-function _t('Your language term')_ in your plugin and generate/update translation-files for it.

## THIS IS AN ALPHA-release ... use at your own risk!!!

Planned features
--------
- [ ] Define translations that you want to provide in order to generate the required folders and translations-files in _app\Locale\_ prepared with all terms that need translation
- [ ] Optionally generate translation-files for ALL other languages, that have all assignments commented out, so they are already prepared for contributions by other users
